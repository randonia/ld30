Objective:  
The objective of this game is to make the most money. You're a space trucker,  
that's what you do. You earn money by making deliveries of various goods to  
different stations throughout the galaxy, but watch out, space can be a   
dangerous place full of debris and worse, pirates!  


How to Play:  
First thing's first, you need some goods to ship. No one is going to care if  
an empty hauler pulls into their station. Space is a mean place though,  
everything's on the escrow system. You're going to have to buy the goods up  
front (albeit at a steep discount) to take them places to sell (back in my day,  
people trusted one another!). Go ahead and approach your target station   
(indicated by the blue triangle and distance marker from your nav system) and  
when you're slow and close enough, press 'G' to start docking. If it helps, use  
your Thrust Vectoring Control 'T' (city-talk for brakes). Careful though,  
sometimes that thing chews through fuel like it's a bottle of Pink Label Scotch.  

Now that you're good and docked you will notice a few things. There are a bunch  
of goods that people want delivered. You get to pick which one, but try to  
maximize it. The price you see is the total price you pay to ship, and upon  
receipt you'll get some much higher value. Seems like these days people just put  
random prices on things, so watch for fluxuations. 'taters today might be gold  
tomorrow, ya know?  

Once you make your selection, leave the station and you'll get the nav cursor  
again. It shows you a distance and direction, that's really all you need. Oh, and  
watch out for asteroids. They might look squishy like potatoes but they'll beat you  
up real nice. If you do take a few dings coming into the station, they'll  
automatically repair you for a fee. Last I reckoned it were 'bout 1 per  
percent. If you don't spend 'em all you get credits or somethin. I don't trust 'em  
too much.  

Oh, and one last thing. Don't run out of fuel. This isn't some candy-apple ice-road  
we're working on. This here is space. I don't want this to be the last time I hear  
from ya.  

That just about cover's it. I felt like I had somethin to tell ya about them drones  
there but it seems I dang ran outta time again.  

Welp. Fly safe, cowpoke.
